Solution:
(a)0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
It is Possible because after every enque of an element, we are dequing it immediately
(b)4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1Â 
It is not possible because we have enqued till 4 before a deque operation. So first deque element would be 0. But given is 4
(c)2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
It is not possible because we have enqued till 2 before a deque operation. So first deque element would be 0. But given is 2
(d)4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
It is not possible because we have enqued till 4 before a deque operation. So first deque element would be 0. But given is 4
